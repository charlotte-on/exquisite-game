          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            According to wikipedia : <br />
            "This technique was invented by surrealists and is similar to an old
            parlour game called Consequences in which players write in turn on a
            sheet of paper, fold it to conceal part of the writing, and then
            pass it to the next player for a further contribution. Surrealism
            principal founder Andr√© Breton reported that it started in fun, but
            became playful and eventually enriching. Breton said the diversion
            started about 1925, but Pierre Reverdy wrote that it started much
            earlier, at least as early as 1918. The name is derived from a
            phrase that resulted when Surrealists first played the game, "Le
            cadavre exquis boira le vin nouveau." ("The exquisite corpse shall
            drink the new wine."). Andr√© Breton writes that the game developed
            at the residence of friends at an old house in Montparnasse, 54 rue
            du Ch√¢teau (no longer existing). Besides himself he mentions Marcel
            Duhamel, Jacques Pr√©vert, Yves Tanguy and Benjamin P√©ret as original
            participants. Henry Miller often played the game to pass time in
            French caf√©s during the 1930s."

            This game is a renewed version of the original game. In addition to
            words I added an emoji keyboard, the particularity of the emojis is
            that they will not be hidden. You choose if you want to make it a
            clue or not, when reading it you can either ignore it or let it
            influence your writing üòâ
          </p>
          <h2>How to play ?</h2>
          <p>
            You will have 10 rounds to write you text. Each turn will begin with
            the last tree words written inside the input to help you write
            meaningful sentences. You have to submit between 30 and 50
            characters, a message will let you know if you're too short or too
            long. When it's the last round, the "Publish" button will turn into
            a "Reveal" Button. <br />
            Enjoy üìù
